# C++ Pointers

C++ pointers are easy and fun to learn. Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.

As you know every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following which will print the address of the variables defined: 
```C++
#include <iostream>

int main () {
   int  var1;
   char var2[10];

   std::cout << "Address of var1 variable: ";
   std::cout << &var1 << std::endl;

   std::cout << "Address of var2 variable: ";
   std::cout << &var2 << std::endl;

   return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result: 

```C++
Address of var1 variable: 0xbfebd5c0
Address of var2 variable: 0xbfebd5b6
```

## What are Pointers?

A **pointer** is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is

```C++
type *var-name;
```

Here, **type** is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C++ type and **var-name** is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk you used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk that you use for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Following are the valid pointer declaration

```C++
int    *ip;    // pointer to an integer
double *dp;    // pointer to a double
float  *fp;    // pointer to a float
char   *ch     // pointer to character
```

The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.

## Using Pointers in C++

There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very frequently. **(a)** We define a pointer variable. **(b)** Assign the address of a variable to a pointer. **(c)** Finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. Following example makes use of these operations

```C++
#include <iostream>


int main () {
   int  var = 20;   // actual variable declaration.
   int  *ip;        // pointer variable 

   ip = &var;       // store address of var in pointer variable

   std::cout << "Value of var variable: ";
   std::cout << var << std::endl;

   // print the address stored in ip pointer variable
   std::cout << "Address stored in ip variable: ";
   std::cout << ip << std::endl;

   // access the value at the address available in pointer
   std::cout << "Value of *ip variable: ";
   std::cout << *ip << std::endl;

   return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces result something as follows

```C++
Value of var variable: 20
Address stored in ip variable: 0xbfc601ac
Value of *ip variable: 20
```
## Pointers in C++

Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C++ programming. There are following few important pointer concepts which should be clear to a C++ programmer

| Sr.No	 | Concept & Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| [C++ Null Pointers](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-null-pointers.html) | C++ supports null pointer, which is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. |
| [C++ Pointer Arithmetic](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-pointer-arithmetic.html) | There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, - |
| [C++ Pointers vs Arrays](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-pointers-vs-arrays.html) | There is a close relationship between pointers and arrays. |
| [C++ Array of Pointers](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-array-of-pointers.html) | You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers. |
| [C++ Pointer to Pointer](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-pointer-to-pointer.html) | C++ allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on. |
| [C++ Passing Pointers to Functions](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-passing-pointers-to-functions.html) | Passing an argument by reference or by address both enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function. |
| [C++ Return Pointer from Functions](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-return-pointer-from-functions.html) | C++ allows a function to return a pointer to local variable, static variable and dynamically allocated memory as well. |
